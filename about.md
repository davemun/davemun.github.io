<p class="message">
  Hi! I am Dave Mun, full stack software engineer! I blog
about my engineering trials and tribulations and my progression to code wizard.
</p>

I like to blog about things such as:

* Javascript, and all its quirks
* Backend JS
* Angular.js
* My archenemy, CSS rotations

My contributions can be seen at my [GitHub](http://github.com/davemun). Some of my more recent projects include a [3D web-conferencing app](http://realfaces.org), the codebase for which you can view [here](http://github.com/realTalkTeam/realTalk), or which I presented at Hack Reactor, and you can [watch me here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5C1OVLiDBE)!
