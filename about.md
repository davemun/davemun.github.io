<p class="message">
  Hi! I am Dave Mun, a software engineer looking for a startup in the Bay Area, currently attending Hack Reactor in San Francisco. I blog
about my programming trials and tribulations and my progression to code wizard.
</p>

I like to blog about things such as:

* Javascript, and all its quirks
* Backend JS
* Angular.js
* My archenemy, raw CSS

My contributions can be seen at my [GitHub](http://github.com/davemun).
